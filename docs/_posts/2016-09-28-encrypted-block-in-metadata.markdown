The encrypted part of the metadata is now decrypted.  Yeah!  I hope all the challenges are as simple.  The initial test file was in fact version 2007 which is apparently rather different from 2010.  As I've decided to support 2010 onwards only I've switched that 2007 file to be an 'unsupported version' test.

The only problem is that the file specification document gives only 92 bytes and it appears there are 108 bytes to be decrypted.  So we have another 16 bytes to get from somewhere.
